## ðŸš€ About Me

[<img src="img/sd311-950.png" width="150px" height="150px" alt="SunDevil311 Logo" />](https://github.com/SunDevil311)

I am an experienced Network Security and Cybersecurity Engineer with over 10 years of experience in designing, implementing, and securing complex network infrastructure. Passionate about advancing network and cyber security standards through continous innovation, with expertise driving secure, scalable, and efficient infrastructures across global and regional projects.

Systems that I specialize in:

- [Palo Alto Networks](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com)
- [PAN-OS Next-Gen Firewalls](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os)
- [Panorama](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/panorama)

With several years of experience in Android development, I have a strong passion
for integrating Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) into my workflow. My
journey began with a desire to replace proprietary apps with open source alternatives, and ever since, Iâ€™ve been exploring and curating the best FLOSS
apps available.
